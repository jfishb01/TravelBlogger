Journey Travel Blog
===========

Website link: http://journeytravelblog.herokuapp.com

Journey is a travel blog that I created as a fun way to learn Ruby on Rails while also documenting my travels abroad to my friends and family at home.

Since I traveled around New Zealand and Southeast Asia extensively via car and plane, I wanted to come up with a blog that would be capable of depicting my crazy travel route across the globe. Although I lost some motivation to keep up with the blog writing as I continued my travels, I had a great time developing the site and learning new technologies in the process.

Here is my own (sadly incomplete) personal blog using the site: http://journeytravelblog.herokuapp.com/users/26b24c5787d0bfa92f55e9c480203c23

About the site
===========

Each Journey blog consists of a series of stops displayed on a map where each stop is its own complete blog entry with photos and written content. As more and more stops get added to the journey, the map grows so that the reader may follow the blogger as they travel around the world. Each user and journey has a hashed URL so that it can be shared with family and friends without requiring their sign-up on the site.

Technologies
===========
- Ruby on Rails framework
- Heroku for app hosting
- Paperclip and prettyphoto-rails for image attachments and display
- Geocoder and gmaps4rails for map components
- PostgreSQL database backend
