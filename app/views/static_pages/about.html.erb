  <p class='content'> This site was designed as a fun side project for me to familiarize myself with rails while also making sure I keep my friends and family up to date during my travels in New Zealand. If for some strange reason you ever happen to find this, please feel free to use this as your own travel blogging tool. Enjoy! </p>
